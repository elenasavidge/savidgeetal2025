Python notebooks and data to reproduce figures in Savidge et al. 2025 "Deteriorating Structural Integrity of Pine Island Glacierâ€™s Southern Ice Shelf (2017--23) Identified with Satellite-Derived Surface Deformation, Ice Velocity, and Strain Rates".

Shapefiles (traced deformation, bounding boxes, and traces coatslines) used in these notebooks are available in the 'paper3_shapefiles' folder.

Code for supplemental figures is included throughout notebooks for Figs. 1 to 5, as well as in FigS3 for that specific figure.
